Written in Python 3.11 with the PyCharm IDE. Source code provided in .py form. Chaos Values.txt has program save data. Chaos Tracker.exe is the script already compiled via Py To Exe to work on Windows.

This was made for a friend of mine who is running very specific 'chaos' rolls for his campaign, which were somewhat annoying to manually do regularly. So I automated it.
